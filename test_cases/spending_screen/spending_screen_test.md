# Idea:

Usage of the _Spending_ screen:
+ The _Transactions_ tab displays monthly transactions
+ The _Traders & Friends_ tab displays the total amount spent per Trader
+ Older transactions are accessed using the carousel

## Out of scope:

+ Transaction requests/notifications (including _Spending_ icon)
+ Formatting (fonts, colors, margins, etc)
+ Link to _Friend information_ screens
+ Icons related to categories (Trader icons will be displayed when available)
+ _Pending_ transaction state
+ Top up functionality
+ _Trader & friends_ categories
+ Computing received payments in the total for a Trader
+ _Trader & Friends_ tab should be called _Categories_
+ Displaying dates in the carousel up to the user creation date
+ Allowing to quickly navigate to different dates in the carousel without loading all the data in between
+ Message in months with no transactions done

## Setup and additional info:

The current behavior is:
1. When the _Spending_ button is used, the  _Login_ screen appears if the user is not logged already
2. Once logged in, the _Transactions_ tab is selected by default and displays the transactions done on the current month, ordered by date (most recent first)
  + The carousel allows to navigate to other months (by clicking or swiping), up to the first transaction done using the app
  + Below the month name, the balance for that month should appear (only payments are considered at this point)
  + Positive transactions have a different color than payments, and also display the + sign
  + Selecting a transaction for a Trader opens the _Trader information_ screen
  + Each trader displays an icon if there is one available
3. In the _Trader & Friends_ tab we see the list of Traders, along with the total amount spent on each Trader, ordered by amount spent that month
  + Selecting a Trader opens the _Trader Information_ screen
